# AutoMobility

The process of self driving can be divided into 3 big parts: Data Input, Processing, Motion Output. The perpose of this github repository is to implement this process. It will be composed of 4 different parts: (1) Vehicle Trajectory Modeling (2) Kalman Filter Implementation (3) Camera Image Processing (4) Motion Planning.
